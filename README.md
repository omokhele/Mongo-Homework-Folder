# Mongo-Homework-Folder

Created the Mongo-Homework folder.
Experimented with express.js by adding a server.js
created a .gitignore and added the node_modules folder
For some reason I couldn't get nodemon to work after the first day. I'm not sure why.
Still experimenting with the bonus question, with faker. I will make a new commit once I get that to work.
